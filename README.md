# LK(lifshitz_kosevich) manually fitting
This program is used to fit the magnetic oscillation by lifshitz_kosevich theory in two pockets case.  
The parameters include m1 and m2, the effective mass of each pocket, t1 and t2, the dingle temperature of each pocket, f1 and f2, the dynamical phase, fb+ and fb-, the berry phase, bf, the center of two oscillation frequency, d, the distance between two oscillation frequency, A and c, the multiple and offset factor.  
Import data to the main, the data format shoule be 'TXT' including two lines, one is the reciprocal of magnetic field, and the other one is the resistance.  
After impoting, the data will be shown in black line, then the parameter can be manually changed to fit this line.  
Also you can change the range of parameters and export the calculated resistance by press exportline button.  
The exportLLE button is useless in this case.  
To show icons corrcectly, file 'lib' should be put in the same folder of main.exe
